### üëã Hey, I'm NiYu

I'm a thinker, a builder, a stubborn soul.

I move between logic and intuition, between silence and chaos.  
I don't write code for the sake of code. I write to *respond*, to *express*, and sometimes just to *resist*.  
I'm not trying to be seen. I'm trying to be real.

I believe in tools that serve people, not trends.  
I believe in naming things with care.  
And I believe that even a fragile presence can leave a lasting impact... If it's honest.

No hype. No sugar. Just Me, NiYu.
